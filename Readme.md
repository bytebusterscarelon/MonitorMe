* 1st Layer is Presentation Layer which will have a login screen for authentication and registration for Nurses & Medical staff. This feature allows users to register and identify their medical credentials and securely store their information in the application servers.

* 2nd Layer is Business Layer which exposes the business logic implemented in the Business logic to potential consumers. We divided this layer into three blocks, in which the Healthcare Subsystem is used to check the data generated from the patient. The other block called Management Subsystem which has an administrative function, tasked with supervising and managing multiple patients, wearable devices and healthcare workers and last layer integrates with microservices one example is uploading patient snapshot to MyMedical Data

* 3rd Layer is Data Access Layer which contains components to abstract the logic required to access the data stores. Such components provide common data access functionality, isolating the upper layers from the specific database technology, and making the application easier to maintain and configure.

* 4th Layer is Persistence Layer which provides several advantages to the software since it is more efficient to save and retrieve data and provide for the whole application. In our context, we have four data sources, namely: Patient vital tracking Devices, patient data, Health Data,  Logging Data and Timeseries DB

One advantage of the proposed  application in the solution framework is the interaction with the end users. Using the platform, Medical healthcare workers can track multiple patients health conditions in a centralized and reliable manner. Note that the proposed real-time monitoring platform can be integrated into vital tracking devices. It is essential to highlight that a distributed system such as this proposed MonitorMe application needs a fully distributed security system.

* **RealTime stream processor**: Stream the real time data on the monitoring screen at Nursing stations

* **Data Analyzer/Rule Engine**: Analyse the vitals based on configured threashold and alert will be sent to Notification publisher in case of anomaly.

* **Notification publisher**: Push Notification to registered Medical Professionals on StayHealth Mobile device as well as on the consolidated monitoring screeen. 

* **Data Storage**: Time series data will be stored for further analysis by the Medical Professionals.

* **Snapshot Component**: APIs will be exposed to download the Patient's vitals snapshot and can be uploaded to MyMedicalData using secure HTTP API call.

* **Data API**: This will be used to query analytical data by the Medical Professional to anyalyze patient's vitals.

![Data Flow](Images/DataFlow.png)


### System Architecture


The diagram represents the workflow of a medical software system designed to monitor and manage patient vital signs in real-time. MonitorMe is responsible for sending real-time updates regarding patients' vital signs to a centralized monitoring screen. 

* Data Transmitter process the collected vital signs data and transmit to Kafka stream(a distributed event streaming platform that handles real-time data feeds) 

* Kafka Stream send the data to Realtime stream processor (Flink) 

* Realtime stream processor send the feed to Monitoring Screen. This process involves the use of a "VitalSign API" and a "VitalSign App" that collectively  
  facilitate the querying and receiving of vital signs data, which is then rotated and displayed on the monitoring interface, also adjust the display as per requirement to display 20 patients every 5 seconds.

* Realtime stream processor also stores vital sign to Timeseries database which is used by Data Analyzer as well as Snapshot Processor

* Data Analyzer
	Rule Engine: A critical component that aids in adjusting alerts based on specific parameters, ensuring that the system remains adaptive and responsive 
					    to varying patient conditions.
	Stream Analytics: Analyze the patients' vitals against the rules from Rule engine and Sent notification to Notification Publisher to notify the Mecical staff. 
	Alert Config APIs: To update the alert configurtion

* Notification Publisher push the notification to Medical professional devices like Stay Healthy Mobile App.

* Snapshot processor: Medical professionals can request snapshots of vital signs data and sync to MyMedicalData via Secure HTTP Gateway API

Overall, the diagram meticulously outlines the interconnected components and processes of a sophisticated software flow dedicated to real-time monitoring, analysis, and management of patient vital signs, emphasizing its utility in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient monitoring practices.

## Operational Viewpoint
Describes how the system will be operated when it is running in the hospital facility. 

* **Nurse Station**: Here nurse need to login to app with Monitoring Interface role to access and monitor patient's vital data. This is the monitoring interface where nurses observe a patient's vital data. The screen displays one patient's data at a time, automatically transitioning to the next patient every five seconds. If a patient's threshold alert is activated, an alert will appear at the top of the screen. These alerts will persist and require nurse acknowledgment before they can be dismissed. If alerts are activated for multiple patients, they will appear sequentially, one following the other.

![Alt text](Images/SequenceDiagramNurseMonitor.png)	


* **Analytical Screen**: This interface is intended for medical professionals who have been granted access privileges to the Analytic Screen. These professionals can solicit time series data within a specific date/time range. The interface also allows them to request patient snapshots for uploading onto the MyMedicalData platform.

![Alt text](Images/SequenceDiagramAnalyticalDataMonitor.png)

* **StayHealthy Mobile App**:  Medical professionals can also download and install the StayHealthy mobile app, provided they have the appropriate role permissions. This will enable them to receive threshold alerts.


## Deployment Viewpoint

* User authentication SSO/LDAP strategies should be enforced along with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access to confidential data.
* Apply current firewall policies/rules to safeguard patient data. This should be done in conjunction with implementing TLS/SSL protocol for encrypted data transmission. 
* Data encryption, access controls, and audit trails are implemented to protect sensitive patient information.


**High Availability and Disaster Recovery**: MonitorMe app will be configured with high availability and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous availability of the real-time dashboard in case of hardware failures or natural disasters. Following factors will be considered to minimize downtime and data loss such as
* Data replication
* Load balancing
* Failover clustering

**Deployment Environment**: We preferred to use Kubernetes as orchestration tool to manage containerized applications to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

**Monitoring and Alerting**:
* Continuous monitoring of system health, performance metrics, and data quality is crucial.
* Prometheus and Grafana will be used for monitoring and alerting.
* Alerts will be configured to notify system administrators in case of system failures, performance degradation, or data discrepancies.

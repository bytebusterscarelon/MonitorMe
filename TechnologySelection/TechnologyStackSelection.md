# MonitorMe System Technology Stack Selection

This document outlines the technology stack selection for each component of the MonitorMe system, detailing the rationale behind each choice based on requirements for performance, scalability, reliability, and security.

## Technology Stack Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Technology**: Apache Kafka
- **Rationale**: Kafka's high throughput, durability, and scalability make it ideal for ingesting real-time data from multiple monitoring devices. Its distributed nature supports scalability and fault tolerance.

### 2. Data Processing and Analytics Engine
- **Technology**: Apache Flink
- **Rationale**: Flink offers excellent real-time processing capabilities, fault tolerance, and is well-suited for complex event processing necessary for analyzing vital signs data and generating timely alerts.

### 3. Notification System
- **Technologies**: Apache Kafka
- **Rationale**: Eventhough we thought of going with RabbitMQ, we chose Kafka as it already been chosen for data ingestion layer. In that way it will reduce deployment scope.

### 4. Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI
- **Technology**: Flutter
- **Rationale**: Flutter is beneficial for both desktop and mobile application development. Since we have already elected to use Flutter for our mobile app, we can also utilize it for desktop development. This will allow us to maintain a single code base from a development perspective.

### 5. StayHealthy Mobile App
- **Technology**: Flutter
- **Rationale**: Flutter enables cross-platform mobile app development from a single codebase, offering native performance, rapid development, and a rich set of UI components for both Android and iOS platforms.

### 6. MyMedicalData Integration Interface
- **Technology**: Spring Boot with RESTful APIs
- **Rationale**: Spring Boot facilitates the rapid development of microservices and RESTful APIs, offering a wide range of security and scalability features ideal for secure, efficient integration with external systems.

### 7. Data Storage
- **Time-Series Database**: InfluxDB
- **Rationale**: InfluxDB is optimized for storing and querying time-series data, providing high performance for real-time and historical data operations.
- **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with strong reliability, feature robustness, and performance for managing structured data and patient metadata.

### 8. System Administration and Monitoring Tools
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Rationale**: Kubernetes supports scalable, automated deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing high availability and efficient resource utilization.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Rationale**: Prometheus offers powerful monitoring and alerting capabilities, while Grafana provides rich visualization options for monitoring data, together ensuring comprehensive insight into system performance and health.

## Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Implement SSL/TLS for secure data transmission and OAuth 2.0 for secure API access. Ensure data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 or similar standards.
- **Development Practices**: Embrace CI/CD practices using tools like Jenkins or Github Actions for automated testing and deployment, enhancing the system's reliability and deployability.

The chosen technology stack is designed to meet the MonitorMe system's performance, scalability, reliability, and security requirements, leveraging modern, proven technologies for robust application development.

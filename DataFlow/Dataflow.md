# MonitorMe System Data Flow Description

This document describes the flow of data through the MonitorMe system, from the initial capture of vital signs by monitoring devices to the final display and interaction with the data by users.

## Data Flow Steps

### Step 1: Data Capture
- **Starting Point**: Vital Sign Monitoring Devices
- **Data Flow**: Devices capture patient vital signs data (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, etc.).
- **To**: Data Ingestion Layer

### Step 2: Data Standardization and Ingestion
- **Component**: Data Ingestion Layer
- **Process**: Standardizes and validates incoming data from various devices.
- **Data Flow**: Standardized data streams sent to the Data Processing and Analytics Engine.

### Step 3: Data Processing and Analysis
- **Component**: Data Processing and Analytics Engine
- **Process**: Analyzes data for trends, anomalies, and generates alerts based on predefined rules.
- **Data Flow 1**: Alerts based on analysis to the Notification System.
- **Data Flow 2**: Processed data for historical records to Data Storage.

### Step 4: Alert Notification and Display
- **Component**: Notification System
- **Process**: Manages and routes alerts to appropriate destinations.
- **Data Flow 1**: Notifications to StayHealthy Mobile App.
- **Data Flow 2**: Alerts to Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI.

### Step 5: Data Visualization and Interaction
- **Component A**: Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI
- **Process A**: Displays real-time and historical data, allows clinical staff to interact with alerts.
- **Component B**: StayHealthy Mobile App
- **Process B**: Provides remote access to alerts and patient data snapshots for doctors.

### Step 6: Historical Data Access and Analysis
- **Component**: Data Storage
- **Process**: Stores and manages access to historical vital signs data.
- **Data Flow**: Historical data requests from UI components to Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI and potentially StayHealthy Mobile App.

### Step 7: Data Integration with MyMedicalData
- **Component**: MyMedicalData Integration Interface
- **Process**: Securely transmits selected patient data snapshots to the MyMedicalData system.
- **Data Flow**: Patient snapshots to MyMedicalData system for permanent record-keeping.

This description should facilitate the creation of a comprehensive Data Flow Diagram for the MonitorMe system, aiding in visualization and understanding of the system's data processing and flow.

# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for MonitorMe System

This document compiles the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) detailing key decisions in the design and development of the MonitorMe system.

## ADR Template
Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Brief summary of the decision.
- **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, superseded, etc.).
- **Context**: The issue or opportunity addressed.
- **Decision**: The decision made.
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes, both positive and negative.

## ADRs

### ADR 1: Use Apache Kafka for Data Ingestion
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for a reliable, scalable way to ingest real-time data from multiple devices.
- **Decision**: Adopt Apache Kafka for high throughput, durability, and scalability.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Efficient handling of high-volume data streams.
  - Negative: Complexity in setup and management.

### ADR 2: Implement Apache Flink for Real-Time Data Processing
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Requirement for processing engine capable of real-time data analysis and alert generation.
- **Decision**: Select Apache Flink for its real-time processing and fault tolerance.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Enables complex event processing on streaming data.
  - Negative: Requires specialized knowledge for configuration.

### ADR 3: Adoption of Flutter for Mobile App Development
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Mobile application must support both iOS and Android without duplicating development efforts.
- **Decision**: Use Flutter for cross-platform development from a single codebase.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Streamlines development and ensures UI consistency across platforms.
  - Negative: May encounter limitations for some platform-specific features.

### ADR 4: Selecting InfluxDB for Time-Series Data Storage
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Vital signs data is inherently time-series, necessitating efficient storage and querying capabilities.
- **Decision**: Choose InfluxDB for optimized time-series data handling.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Improved performance for time-based data operations.
  - Negative: Adds to the technological diversity, increasing operational complexity.

### ADR 5: Kubernetes for Container Orchestration
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: System components are containerized, requiring an orchestration solution for scalability and reliability.
- **Decision**: Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Enhances scalability, deployability, and manageability of applications.
  - Negative: Complexity of Kubernetes management and configuration.

### ADR 6: Utilizing React for Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for a responsive and dynamic UI for displaying real-time and historical patient data.
- **Decision**: Adopt React for its efficient update mechanisms and component-based architecture.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Facilitates development of an interactive and responsive UI.
  - Negative: Requires React expertise for development and maintenance.

## Summary
These ADRs provide a framework for understanding the architectural and technological choices made in developing the MonitorMe system, ensuring alignment with the project's goals and requirements.

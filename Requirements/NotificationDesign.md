# MonitorMe System Notification Design

This document outlines the notification design for the MonitorMe system, leveraging Apache Kafka to ensure timely, reliable, scalable, and flexible alerting for hospital environments.

## Overview

The MonitorMe system requires a robust notification system to alert medical professionals about patient conditions in real-time. Utilizing Kafka, this design ensures minimal delay, high reliability, scalability to handle varying loads, and the flexibility to support multiple notification channels.

## Notification Design with Kafka

### Step 1: Alert Generation

- **Process**: The Data Processing and Analytics Engine analyzes incoming data streams in real time, identifying conditions that warrant alerts based on predefined criteria (e.g., vital signs thresholds).
- **Output**: Alerts are generated and published to a dedicated Kafka topic for distribution.

### Step 2: Alert Distribution

- **Kafka as a Central Hub**: Kafka acts as the hub for alert management, storing and distributing alerts to various consumers.
    - **UI Dashboard**: Alerts relevant to specific nurses' stations or monitoring screens are consumed by a dedicated consumer group, ensuring staff are promptly informed.
    - **Mobile Notifications**: A separate consumer group processes alerts for the StayHealthy Mobile App, forwarding them to a mobile notification service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.

### Step 3: Notification Delivery

- **UI Updates**: The Consolidated Monitoring Screen UI updates in real-time to display alerts, requiring efficient, low-latency data consumption from Kafka.
- **Mobile Push Notifications**: Services like FCM ensure the delivery of push notifications to medical professionals' devices, with the mobile app presenting alert details and potential actions.

### Step 4: Handling Failures and Acknowledgments

- **Reliability Mechanisms**: Kafka's durability and consumer offset management ensure no alert is lost and can be reprocessed in case of failures.
- **Acknowledgment Tracking**: Alert acknowledgments are tracked by having the UI and mobile app publish acknowledgment events back to Kafka, enabling response time monitoring and ensuring accountability.

## Design Considerations

- **Partitioning and Consumer Groups**: Utilize Kafka's partitioning and consumer groups to enhance scalability and performance, ensuring efficient alert consumption.
- **Kafka Streams or KSQL**: For complex alert processing needs, Kafka Streams or KSQL can be used to preprocess alerts before they reach consumers.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure all alert transmissions through Kafka and external services like FCM are secure, encrypted, and compliant with data protection regulations.

By leveraging Kafka's strengths, the MonitorMe system's notification design meets all requirements for an effective and efficient alerting mechanism in hospital settings.
